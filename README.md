Restaurant Recommender System Using User-Based Filtering 


Abstract 
Culinary has become part of people’s lives today. Culinary is a part of life that is closely related to daily 
food consumption. Recently, culinary is not just about food needs, but also about a community lifestyle. 
People are increasingly like eating in restaurant, so the number of restaurants that are growing are even 
more. With a growing number of restaurants, many websites or applications provide information about 
restaurants. Some information from websites or applications about restaurants still use filtering 
methods based on places or types of cuisine. However, it is still possible to display choices that are
relevant to the mood of the user and other relevant filters dependent on the user rather than the types 
of restaurants existing in the city. 


How this project will be helpful? 
This project will be helpful in recommending restaurants and cafes based on user mood and various 
filters. Users can have various moods while choosing restaurants like happy, sad, hungry, stressed, etc. 
The mood of the user will be identified by facial recognition rather than text or similar inputs. This would 
ensure better identification of user’s mood. 
Method to be implemented 
The method used in this project will be K-means clustering method. Restaurant data will be collected 
from public datasets which will be cleaned based on various requirements. User’s mood will be 
identified from photo taken from their smartphone camera. After that, the cleaned data will be used to
generate a system to recommend restaurants in a particular city. This project will only take into account 
restaurants which are rated by previous customers in order to provide better suggestions. 

Final results/outcomes 
The final result achieved from this project will be a recommendation system which will recommend 
restaurants based various filters. This project will take mood of the user as primary filter and 
recommend restaurants based on it in a particular city.
